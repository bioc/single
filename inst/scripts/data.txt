Data in inst/extdata/:

- Experimental data, DNA strands measured by Oxford Nanopore sequencer, and derivatives: 
 	. test_sequences.fastq: sequenced DNA strands.
 	. test_sequences.sorted.bam: aligned DNA sequences (pre-processed with samtools)
	. train_seqs_500.sorted.bam: aligned DNA sequences (pre-processed with samtools)
	. Barcodes_table.txt: table indicating name of sequence and barcode.
- Experimental data, DNA sequence obtained by Sanger sequencing (fragment):
	. ref_seq.fasta (DNA sequence of KlenTaq polymerase gene).
- Pre-processed data (script in inst/scripts/)
	. fits_example.txt
	. train_example.txt

Note: You can think of the experimental data as simulated data.
