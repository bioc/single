\arguments{
\item{input_sam_file}{File containing the counts per position returned by samtools mpileup}

\item{aux_fitted_file}{File containing the results of the SINGLE model. It will be saved when you run single_train_model.}

\item{output_txt_file}{String. Prefix for output files}

\item{reference_sequence}{Reference sequence: vector of characters, as returned by load_reference_sequence}

\item{pos_start}{Numeric. Position to start analyzing, counting starts from 1 and it refers to reference used for minimap2 alignment.}

\item{pos_end}{Numeric. Position to stop analyzing, counting starts from 1 and it refers to reference used for minimap2 alignment.}

\item{comment.char}{Character used to indicate comments in the input_sam_file}

\item{gaps_weights}{One of "minimum","none","mean". How to assign qscores to deletions.}

\item{remove.first.reverse}{Logical. Do you want to remove first position in the reverse reads?}

\value{
Writes txt file
